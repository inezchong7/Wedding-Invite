<h1>Wedding Invite 💌</h1> 
<p>I wanted to cut costs and paper wastage while making something uniquely mine, so I created my own wedding invitation site from scratch. I am adopting the agile methodology to develop this passion project.</p>

<h2>📋Planning</h2>
<p>Some essential features I wanted my invite to have:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Guest management: manage RSVP numbers, food preferences</li>
  <li>RSVP options: offer food, allergy, dietary restriction options</li>
  <li>Communication tools: announcements, updates or reminders (with venue/ time/ date changes in mind)</li>
  <li>Cash gift integration: integrate with external payment services (eg. PayPal, banks)</li>
  <li>Event timeline: whole day timeline including ceremony and reception</li>
  <li>Directions: embed venue maps, images</li></li>
</ul>

<p>Some nice to have features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Wedding countdown: countdown timer for anticipation</li>
  <li>Live-streaming: enable long-distance guests to participate</li>
</ul>
