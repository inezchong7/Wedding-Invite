<h1>Wedding Invite 💌</h1> 
<p>I wanted to cut costs and paper wastage while making something uniquely mine, so I created my own wedding invitation site from scratch. I am adopting the agile methodology to develop this passion project.</p>

<h2>📋Planning</h2>
<p>Some essential features I wanted my invite to have:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Guest management: manage RSVP numbers, food preferences</li>
  <li>RSVP options: offer food, allergy, dietary restriction options</li>
  <li>Communication tools: announcements, updates or reminders (with venue/ time/ date changes in mind)</li>
  <li>Cash gift integration: integrate with external payment services (eg. PayPal, banks)</li>
  <li>Event timeline: whole day timeline including ceremony and reception</li>
  <li>Directions: embed venue maps, images</li></li>
</ul>

<p>Some nice to have features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Wedding countdown: countdown timer for anticipation</li>
  <li>Live-streaming: enable long-distance guests to participate</li>
</ul>

<p>Things to decide:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Personalised invites? (custom greetings, make changes to the guest list)</li>
  <li>Relational database (expand each invite to see how many guests and who are coming, contact details, food preferences)</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

<p>Information to collect:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How many people are coming</li>
  <li>Names</li>
  <li>Dietary Restrictions: none, vegan, gluten-free, allergies</li>
  <li>Contact details</li>
</ul>
